# Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Benchmark Code

This repo contains the code from the [benchmark blog post](http://drivendata.co/blog/disaster-response-roof-type-benchmark/) for the [Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/58/disaster-response-roof-type/page/142/) competition sponsored by MathWorks.

`BenchmarkBlog.mlx` is the MATLAB live script of the benchmark code with detailed instructions on how to load, process, and predict on the data. `resnet_presaved.mat` contains the pretrained ResNet-18 model used in the benchmark.

*Note: To access these files you have to download or clone the repo.*

`Benchmark_code.m` is the MATLAB code file of the benchmark, which is viewable directly on GitHub.
